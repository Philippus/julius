Julius - Roman Numerals
=======================

This is a library for working with Roman Numerals in Scala.
It was started to get more comfortable with functional programming, Scala and property based testing.

It aims to:
- provide a pleasant API to the users of the library.
- provide the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
- do as the romans do: the implemented algorithms are only allowed to manipulate the roman symbols directly, so no converting back and forth from integers.
- use idiomatic Scala
- use functional style of programming
- use property based testing with ScalaCheck
